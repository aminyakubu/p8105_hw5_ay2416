```

Extracting the filepaths and names into lists

``` r
filepaths = list.files("./data", pattern = "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)

filenames = basename(filepaths)
```

Writing function to read the data

``` r
read_fx = function(data, name){
  
  list(read_csv(file = data) %>% mutate(id = name))
  
}
```

Now iterating using `map` function to read all the csv files and bind them together

``` r
x = purrr::map2(filepaths, filenames, read_fx)
```

Describe dataset ---

Summary statistics

Summarize within cities to obtain the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).
